# Contact Form

[Deployed Site on AWS Amplify](https://master.d3sspyoigdzs9k.amplifyapp.com/)

## Description

This web app is a simple contact form created with Gastby and Theme UI.  It could be deployed on a cloud server to send and store messages from users. One potential option I'd try is AWS Amplify.

It uses the [Gastby Advanced Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter)
